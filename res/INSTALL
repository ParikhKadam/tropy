Basic Installation
==================
  Briefly, this distribution package requires no installation step. You
can move this directory to any suitable location, for example, `/opt/tropy`,
and start the `tropy` binary there. In the following instructions, change
`/opt/tropy` to your preferred location.

1. Move this directory to /opt/tropy
2. Add /opt/tropy to your PATH environment variable
3. Copy the Tropy icons:
   cp -r /opt/tropy/resources/icons ~/.local/share/
4. Register Tropy's mimetypes:
   cp -r /opt/tropy/resources/mime ~/.local/share/
5. Copy the file `tropy.desktop` file:
   cp /opt/tropy/tropy.desktop ~/.local/share/applications/
6. And update MIME cache database:
   update-desktop-database ~/.local/share/applications/

Updating
========
  When updating to newer version of Tropy, simply replace your
the entire installation directory with the new one.

Dark Theme
==========
  When using the dark theme you may want to force to use your
GTK theme's dark variant. Generally, you will have to restart
Tropy for the window frame to update accordingly; if the menu
bar does not use the dark theme by default, try starting
Tropy with `env GTK_THEME=Adwaita:dark tropy` using your
preferred theme.

Custom Themes
=============
  You can adjust Tropy's themes by placing `style-light.css`
and `style-dark.css` files in your user-data folder (or just
`style.css` for adjusting all themes).

Sandbox
=======
  By default, Tropy requires your kernel to be configured with
`CONFIG_USER_NS` and `sysctl kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone=1`.

  As a fallback, you can `sudo chown root chrome-sandbox` and
`chmod 4755 chrome-sandbox` to use the SETUID sandbox instead, or start
Tropy with the `--no-sandbox` flag.

System Libraries
================
  The Tropy tarball is bundled with Electron and includes pre-
compiled modules in `resources/app.asar.unpacked/lib/node` and
`resources/app.asar.unpacked/lib/vendor`. If you already have
a system-wide installation of Electron, you can use that instead,
provided it has the same major version as the one bundled here.

Similarly, you can use your distribution's libvips version instead
of the bundled image libraries. To do this, simply remove the
`resources/app.asar.unpacked/lib/vendor` folder. Please note, that
the major/minor version should match the one included here. Moreover,
the image formats supported by a custom-packaged Tropy may vary,
depending on which libraries are available in your distribution.
